# Missing Getter and Setter Methods in Ruby Classes

This example demonstrates a common error in Ruby: forgetting to define getter and setter methods for instance variables.  This can lead to unexpected behavior when attempting to access or modify the object's internal state.

The `bug.rb` file shows the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.rb` file provides the corrected code with appropriate getter and setter methods. 

This bug is relevant because proper encapsulation and use of accessors are fundamental principles of object-oriented programming in Ruby.
